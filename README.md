### Changes
1. [x] Adding appropriate index checking for the peekMin() and removeMin() methods.
   - Just in case user makes a dumb mistake

2. [x] Fixed the removeMin() method to utilize ArrayList methods better.
   - Had to give up single line of code, but basically the same code

3. [x] Fixed peekMin() method to remove unecessary variables. Also utilizes foreach loop for cleaner look(being able to start at one index later isn't that big of a difference).

4. [x] Added some QUALITY test cases in the main method.
